[`Live-Version`](https://feuerwehr-magdlos.de/)


## Developing

This website is created with svelte kit.
Once you've checked out the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
for easier coding i started it like this:

```bash
sudo npm run dev -- --port 80 --host 192.168.178.48
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
